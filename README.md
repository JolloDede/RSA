# RSA
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for data transmission.
RSA is a somewhat slow algorithm thats why it's mostly used to share keys for symmetric key cryptography.

I have Implemented a Version wich generates a public and a private key from user input.

You have to give two prime numbers (p and q) and a third comprime to ((p - 1) * (q - 1)) then then algorithm works out the public and the private key.
